Can all points be fit perfetctly by a straight line. no !
One alternative is: Locally weighted regression. It is a non-parametric learning algorithm. which means that the amount of data & parameters grows witht the size of the data.

look at the local neighborhood of x, and fit a straight line and make a prediction based on this line. So essentially, focus on points nearby and fit a straight line to make predictions.
